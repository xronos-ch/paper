  XRONOS (<https://xronos.ch>) is an open data infrastructure for the backbone of the archaeological record – chronology. It provides open access to published radiocarbon dates and other chronometric data from any period, anywhere in the world.

  Chronometric data has been one of the principle domains in which open data and open science approaches have been applied over the last ten years. Comprehensive compilations of radiocarbon dates have become available for many parts of the world in the last decade and, as natural next step, there are now several initiatives to collate this data globally, including the retrieval tool c14bazAAR [@SchmidEtAl2019], the IntChron exchange format [@BronkRamseyEtAl2019], and the synthetic database p3kc14 [@BirdEtAl2022]. This move from archiving individual datasets to producing a living open data infrastructure for archaeological chronologies raises a number of challenges. Radiocarbon datasets are still sorely lacking for many parts of the world and, even in those regions with good coverage, the quality of data is highly uneven and largely undocumented. There exists no central repository ensuring the long-term sustainability and completeness of these datasets, and the potential of placing other sources of chronometric information (e.g. dendrochronology, typological dating) in an open data framework has hardly been realised at all.
  
  Here, building on and complementing these initiatives, we present XRONOS: a new web-based platform for chronometric data from archaeological contexts worldwide, combining an open data repository with tools for importing, curating and analysing chronometric information from diverse sources. The principal design goals of the software are to combine all available sources of radiocarbon and other chronometric data in single database; develop robust tools for the continuous ingestion and refinement of this data; and disseminate this data within an open and FAIR framework, embedding it in the wider world of Linked Open Data in archaeology and beyond.
  
  This paper outlines the conceptual and technical infrastructure developed to realise these goals in XRONOS’ initial phases of development (2019 and 2021–2023), including a generalised data model for site and radiocarbon information, extendable to other chronometric data; an R- and Ruby-based pipeline for continuous ingestion of data from a variety of sources; continuous, semi-automated data cleaning protocols; a Ruby-on-Rails application providing a web-based frontend to the data and a REST API for programmatic access; and an R package for interfacing with the API. We believe the XRONOS framework provides more open, more reliable, and more comprehensive access to chronometric data than previously available, as well as a foundation for its continuous expansion and refinement.

## Introduction

* Chronometric modelling depends on ready access to chronometric data!
* Luckily, we do have a lot of it.
* Moving from 'open data' (uploading a CSV) to 'open infrastructure' [@CITE]

In this paper we:

* Review the state of the art in radiocarbon data compilation (and other chronometric data, such as they are), highlighting the need for XRONOS
* Describe XRONOS' software architecture, design goals, and currently-implemented features
  * With a focus on the choices we made in representing/modelling chronological data
* Assess the current state of the software and database, and give case studies of how it can be used
* Conclude with our future plans

## Compilations of radiocarbon dates

* Radiocarbon dates used to be regularly compiled and published in *Radiocarbon* (so it was 'open data' before it was cool), but this is no longer practical.
* Plus the bare measurements are of limited use without contextual information, which labs don't usually have access to.
* So even though radiocarbon data comes from a relatively limited number of sources [@IntCalLabList] and has relatively standardised reporting conventions [@Millard2014], in practice data has to be manually compiled from literature – this is time-consuming!
* Since at least 19XX, there have been efforts to systematically collect and compile this information
* Graph of number of dates/databases through time
* But this has been fragmentary: we counted at least XX databases
* And patchy: highly uneven spatial and geographic coverage, different data collected, different conventions for recording data

## Time for a global radiocarbon database?

* Regional databases are put together *ad hoc* and rarely continuously maintained over long periods
* The coverage of these databases is uneven, systematically biased, and duplicative of each other
* Other forms of chronometric data (dendro, typology, sea level, etc.) remain relatively untouched

* Recent moves towards a global synthesis: c14bazAAR [@SchmidEtAl2019], IntChron [@BronkRamseyEtAl2019], p3k14c [@BirdEtAl2022]
* Each taking a different approach, pros and cons
* We see a need for something that is comprehensive, unified, living
* And we don't see why it should be limited to radiocarbon: what about other radiometric dates? Dendro? Typologies?

## XRONOS

### Design goals and principles

* Inspired by GBIF, which manages to integrate large amounts of data from diverse sources into a signal, consistent database

### Data model

TODO: Figure: conceptual scheme, centred on chrons (i.e. an idealised form of the database).

XRONOS data model is based on the concept of a set of coordinates in time or *chron*.
We define a chron as an assertion that links human activity with a particular point in space and time.
More concretely, our data model currently encompasses three types of chron: radiocarbon dates, typological dates (e.g. 'Early Neolithic') and dendrochronological dates.
However we anticipate that the concept will accommodate all sorts of absolute and relative dating techniques, as the scope of the database expands.

Chrons are useful conceptually because they emphasise that dates from different sources still consist of essentially the same kind of information: a statement locating an event in space and time.
We thereby avoid privileging certain sources of chronological data over (as might be the case if, for example, we treated 'period' as a fixed attribute of a site) and can accommodate contradictory (e.g. differences of opinion on typological classification).
This is important given that XRONOS aspires to be an authoratative 'backbone' with a global scope, so we cannot realistically impose a single chronological scheme or resolve conflicting information provided by specialists.
They are useful practically because they expose a common interface for attributes that all types of chronological information share, such as a *terminus post quem*, *terminus ante quem*, and midpoint estimate.
This allows applications that use XRONOS' data model (including XRONOS itself) to collate chronological data from multiple sources, without necessarily having to be aware of the pecularities of each type of dating.

Key to 'unifying' chrons in this way is a common model of time.
* Time element can be represented as a probability distribution
  * Inspired by OxCal, aoristic analysis
  * How you get to the PD representation can be very different (e.g. calibration vs. aoristic), but the important thing is the endpoint is the same.

Chrons are located in space through association to a *sample* – the physical object from which a chronological determination was made.
The location of samples is represented with geographical coordinates and an associated coordinate reference system (CRS), though since in practice the precise location of single samples is rarely available, this property is usually inherited from the site.
We also record relevant metadata on the nature of the sample.
For radiocarbon dates, for example, we follow established conventions [@Millard2014] in recording the type (e.g. charcoal, charred seed) and, where applicable, taxonomic designation (e.g. TODO, TODO) of the organic material used for dating.
For typological dates, an ideal scenario would be for the sample to represent the particular object from which an inference was made (e.g. 'Natufian' might be inferred from 'lunate-type microlith').
In practice, the best we can glean from most published datasets is the type of material used (e.g. 'pottery', 'lithics').
The same sample can be associated with multiple chrons, including different types of chron.
This is useful, for example, for representing replicate radiocarbon dates on the same sample, or radiocarbon dates and dendrochronological made on the same section of wood for wiggle-matching.

* Contextual information: sample, context, site
  * Different types of xrons can be attached to the same sample, context, or site, as appropriate
* Bibliographic references
* Paper trail

### Software architecture

* CRUD Rails app
  * Not so exciting, but try to keep up with modern standards, remain accessible, etc.
  * Data browser
* API
  * R package
* Linked data

## Implementation

The first prototype of XRONOS was developed in 2019.
It has been under sustained development 2021–2024 with the first public release in July 2021.

* Assessment of XRONOS' coverage
* Tale from the trenches: duplicate processing?
* Tale from the trenches: cleaning species and countries?
* Case study of use?

## Conclusion

* Chronology is the backbone of the archaeological record
* XRONOS could be a backbone for a universe of linked open data resources...
* ...but sustainability is a challenge.
  * We're coming to the end of our project funds
  * We'll try to get more, but you never know (grant-based science and long-term investments in digital infrastructure don't work so well together!)
  * Future sustainability
