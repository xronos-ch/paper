In addition, for every calibrated determination or modeled date, the following should be reported: (4) the calibration curve and any reservoir offset used; (5) the software used for calibration, including version number, the options and/or models used, and wherever possible a citation of a published description of the software; and (6) the calibrated date given as a range (or ranges) with an associated probability on a clearly identifiable calendar timescale.},

	abstract = {The development of chronologies relies on integrating information from a
number of different sources. In addition to direct dating evidence, such
as radiocarbon dates, researchers will have contextual information which
might be an environmental sequence or the context in an archaeological
site. This information can be combined through Bayesian or other types of
age-model. Once a chronology has been developed, this information can be
used to estimate, for example, chronological uncertainties, rates of
change, or the age of material which has not been directly dated.Dealing
with the information associated with chronology building is complicated
and re-evaluation of chronologies often requires structured information
which is hard to access. Although there are many databases with primary
dating information, these often do not contain all of the information
needed for a chronology. The Chronological Query Language ({CQL}) developed
for {OxCal} was intended to be a convenient way of pulling such information
together for Bayesian analysis. However, even this does not include much
of the associated information required for reusing data in other
analyses.The {IntChron} initiative builds on the framework set up for the
{INTIMATE} (Integrating Ice core, Marine and Terrestrial Records)
chronological database (Bronk Ramsey et al. 2014) and is primarily an
information exchange format and data visualization tool which enables
users to pull together the types of information needed for chronological
analysis. It is intended for use with multiple dating methodologies and
while it will be integrated with {OxCal}, is intended to be an open format
suitable for use with other software tools. The file format is {JSON} which
is easily readable in software such as R, Python and {MatLab}. {IntChron} is
not primarily intended to be a data depository but rather an index of
sites where information is stored in the relevant format. As an initial
step, databases of radiocarbon dates from the Oxford Radiocarbon
Accelerator Unit (including those for the {NERC} radiocarbon facility), the
{RESET} tephra database, the {INTIMATE} chronological database and regional
radiocarbon databases for Egypt and Southern Africa are all linked. The
intention is that users of {OxCal} will also be able to make published data
accessible to others and to store working data, visible only to the user,
to be used with the associated analysis tools. The {IntChron} site allows
data from third party sources to be accessed through a representational
state transfer ({REST}) application programming interface ({API}) in a number
of different formats ({JSON}, csv, txt, oxcal) and associated bibliographic
information in {BibTeX} format.The aim of the {IntChron} initiative is to make
it easy for users to provide data (in the single {JSON} format with limited
minimum requirements) as well as to access data and tools, while promoting
robust chronologies including realistic estimates of uncertainties. It is
hoped that this will help to bring the chronological research communities
to a point where data access is as easy as it is in some other fields.
This is particularly important for Early Career Researchers and for those
seeking to use large datasets in novel ways.},

We present a synthetic, global-scale archaeological radiocarbon database composed of 180,070 radiocarbon dates that have been cleaned according to a standardized sample selection criteria.

pressing need for an archaeological information infrastructure that will
allow us to archive, access, integrate, and mine disparate data sets. This

its development, and outlines initial steps toward its realization.
Finally, it argues that such a cyberinfrastructure has enormous potential

  abstract = {This paper returns to the relationship of “narrative versus database” (an argument originally made by Lev Manovich in 2001) as one that can be further addressed. A specific issue persists in text analysis research in the digital humanities: the difficulty of representing the figurative meaning of narratives through digital tools. Towards an accommodation, this paper adopts a narratological framework in order to propose alternative models of content management and organization that more closely resemble figurative meaning making in human language. These alternative models therefore better allow for the computational representation of figurative elements that N. Katherine Hayles describes as “the inexplicable, the unspeakable, the ineffable” of narrative literature. This paper argues that the construction of figurative meaning through paradigmatic substitution (as part of an imaginary vocabulary that is drawn from in the process of meaning making) is difficult to account for in the relational database—arguably still the most culturally prominent database model. By focusing on NoSQL (“no” or “not only” Structured Query Language) databases, this paper explores how layers of figurative meaning can be represented together through these flexible and non-relational models. In particular, the ability of non-relational databases to group together multiple values—encouraging their association, comparison, and juxtaposition—can be analyzed as a computational albeit imprecise counterpart to the formation of paradigmatic and figurative meaning. Thus, towards accounting for a word, image, or idea’s layers of meaning as expressed in literature, this paper offers a study of the limitations of digital tools and their critical negotiation with humanities research and reflection.},

In this chapter, a case is made for a database approach that allows for the integration of all project data in a way that fits productively into the research program, and which makes the resulting data maximally useful for analysis, sharing and publication. A research database platform should accommodate highly diverse data that is dispersed over space and time, that is characterized by high variability, that is semi-structured, and that contains uncertainty and disagreements. Integration of spatial, temporal, textual, lexical, and multi-media data should be supported naturally and intuitively. In this chapter, an evaluation of traditional options for managing data leads to a discussion of a hybrid model, as implemented by OCHRE using XML, that is inspired by all the major database paradigms—the hierarchical, the relational, and the graph/network—taking advantage of the best features of each. An appropriately generic upper ontology provides an underlying framework for managing data of all kinds.},

Often described as a complex hunting and gathering society with increased sedentism, intensive plant exploitation and associated with an increase in artistic and symbolic material culture, it is positioned between the earlier Upper- and Epi-Palaeolithic and the early Neolithic, when plant cultivation and subsequently animal domestication began. The Natufian has thus often been seen as a necessary pre-adaptation for the emergence of Neolithic economies in southwest Asia. Previous work has pointed to the Mediterranean woodland zone of the southern Levant as the ‘core zone’ of the Early Natufian. Here we present a new sequence of 27 AMS radiocarbon dates from the Natufian site Shubayqa 1 in northeast Jordan. The results suggest that the site was occupied intermittently between \textasciitilde 14,600 − 12,000 cal BP. The dates indicate the Natufian emerged just as early in eastern Jordan as it did in the Mediterranean woodland zone. This suggests that the origins and development of the Natufian were not tied to the ecological conditions of the Mediterranean woodlands, and that the evolution of this hunting and gathering society was more complex and heterogeneous than previously thought.}

This is expressed as an offset between the radiocarbon ages of samples from the two reservoirs at a single point in time. The marine reservoir effect (MRE) has been a major concern in the radiocarbon community, as it introduces an additional source of error that is often difficult to accurately quantify. For this reason, researchers are often reluctant to date marine material where they have another option. The influence of this phenomenon makes the study of the MRE important for a broad range of applications. The advent of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) has reduced sample size requirements and increased measurement precision, in turn increasing the number of studies seeking to measure marine samples. These studies rely on overcoming the influence of the MRE on marine radiocarbon dates through the worldwide quantification of the local parameter ΔR, that is, the local variation from the global average MRE. Furthermore, the strong dependence on ocean dynamics makes the MRE a useful indicator for changes in oceanic circulation, carbon exchange between reservoirs, and the fate of atmospheric CO2, all of which impact Earth's climate. This article explores data from the Marine Reservoir Database and reviews the place of natural radiocarbon in oceanic records, focusing on key questions (e.g., changes in ocean dynamics) that have been answered by MRE studies and on their application to different subjects.},

As the use of chronometric data in general becomes more ambitious, we must pause and assess how reliable these data are. Here, we forward a set of evaluation criteria which take into account archaeological (e.g. associational, stratigraphic) and chronometric (e.g. pre-treatment and measurement) criteria. We intend to use such criteria to evaluate a large 14C dataset we have assembled to investigate Late Glacial settlement in Europe, the Near East and North Africa, supported by the Leverhulme Trust.

A comparison of frequency distributions of 14C dates from North America and Australia to modeled estimates of historical population growth for these continents from the HYDE 3.1 database shows similarities, providing confidence in long-term estimates of population growth using both methods.

  abstract = {Archaeological data provide a potential to investigate the diffusion of technological and cultural traits. However, much of this research agenda currently needs more formal quantitative methods to address small sample sizes and chronological uncertainty. This paper introduces a novel Bayesian framework for inferring the shape of diffusion curves using radiocarbon data associated with the presence/absence of a particular innovation. We developed two distinct approaches: 1) a hierarchical model that enables the fitting of an s-shaped diffusion curve whilst accounting for inter-site variations in the probability of sampling the innovation itself, and 2) a non-parametric model that can estimate the changing proportion of the innovation across user-defined time-blocks. The robustness of the two approaches was first tested against simulated datasets and then applied to investigate three case studies, the first pair on the diffusion of farming in prehistoric Japan and Britain and the third on cycles of changes in the burial practices of later prehistoric Britain.}

Although its universal and straightforward premise is appealing and undoubtedly offers some unique opportunities for research on long-term comparative demography, practical applications are far from trivial and riddled with issues pertaining to the very nature of the proxy under examination. Here I review the most common criticisms concerning the nature of radiocarbon time–frequency data as a demographic proxy, focusing on key statistical and inferential challenges. I then examine and compare recent methodological advances in the field by grouping them into three approaches: reconstructive, null-hypothesis significance testing, and model fitting. I will then conclude with some general recommendations for applying these techniques in archaeological and paleo-demographic research.},

We describe the current status of the Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database (CARD), a searchable collection of more than 36,000 14C dates from archaeological and paleontological sites from across North America. CARD, built by the late Dr Richard Morlan of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, consists of uncalibrated 14C data as well as information about the material dated, the cultural association of the date (e.g. Paleoindian, Archaic, Woodland), and its geographic location. The database can be used to study questions relating to prehistoric demography, migrations, human vulnerability to environmental change, and human impact on the landscape, but biases relating to sampling intensity and taphonomy must first be accounted for. Currently, Canada and the northern United States are well represented in the database, while the southern United States is underrepresented. The frequency of 14C dates associated with archaeological sites increases through time from 15,000 cal yr BP until European contact, which likely reflects, among other factors, both the destruction of older cultural carbon due to erosion and dissolution and increasing population numbers through time. An exploratory analysis of the dates reveals their distribution in both time and space, and suggests that the database is sufficiently complete to enable quantitative analysis of general demographic trends.},

  abstract = {Background Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers – data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. Conclusions/Significance Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the NSF-sponsored DataNET (including projects like DataONE) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

Only by dating independently of typology is it possible to understand typological development itself (Müller 2004). Here radiometric dating methods, especially those based on carbon isotopy, still play the most important role. For evaluations exceeding the intra-site level, it is particularly important that such data is collected in large numbers and that the dates are easily accessible. Also, new statistical analyses, such as sequential calibration based on Bayesian methods, do not require single dates, but rather demand a greater number. By their combination significantly more elaborate results can be achieved compared to the results from conventional evaluation (e. g. Whittle et al. 2011). A second premise of RADON is that of „Open Access“. This approach continues to be applied in the international research community, which we welcome as a highly positive development. The radiocarbon database RADON has been committed to this principle for more than 12 years. In this database 14C data – primarily of the Neolithic of Central Europe and Southern Scandinavia – is collected and successively augmented.}

As Stuart Piggot once wrote, ‘Any enquiry into the past which does not reckon with the dimension of time is obviously nonsense’ (Piggott 1959: 51). It might seem obvious that time is important to archaeology simply because archaeology is about the past; it is a historical science or discipline. On that recognition, then, a book about time is not only reasonable but essential. Yet, on further reflection, one might also ask, how much is there to actually say about time? Most archaeologists, when asked about time, might think about dating and chronology and, indeed, this is perhaps what first springs to mind. Certainly, issues of dating have been, and will continue to be, of major concern to archaeologists but since this is not a book about dating techniques – and my apologies to the reader who opened this book thinking it was – what is left to say? Well, quite a lot actually. What I can at least say, in anticipation, is that this book aims to explore time as a theoretical concept and how this is understood and employed in contemporary archaeology. For it is precisely because time lies at the heart of archaeology that we may take it too much for granted, and fail to see the ways in which time, in particular the way we understand time, affects the way we do archaeology.},

In South America, although the background data on this issue has increased exponentially in recent decades, the core questions related to the temporal and spatial patterns of the colonization process remain open. In this paper we tackle these questions in the light of the quantitative analysis of a screened radiocarbon database of more than 1600 early dates. We explore the frequency of radiocarbon dates as proxies for assessing population growth; and define a reliable and statistically well supported lower chronological bound (not to the exact date) for the earliest human arrival. Our results suggest that the earliest chronological threshold for the peopling of South America should be between 16,600 and 15,100, with a mean estimated date \textasciitilde{} 15,500 cal BP (post Last Glacial Maximum). Population would have grown until the end of Antarctic Cold Reversal stadial \textasciitilde 12,500 cal BP at the time of the main extinctions of megafauna–, when the increase rate slows, probably as a result of the changes that occurred in the trophic niche of humans.},

The most widely used method of calibration can be seen as a simple application of Bayesian statistics, which uses both the information from the new measurement and information from the 14C calibration curve. In most dating applications, however, we have larger numbers of 14C measurements and we wish to relate those to events in the past. Bayesian statistics provides a coherent framework in which such analysis can be performed and is becoming a core element in many 14C dating projects. This article gives an overview of the main model components used in chronological analysis, their mathematical formulation, and examples of how such analyses can be performed using the latest version of the OxCal software (v4). Many such models can be put together, in a modular fashion, from simple elements, with defined constraints and groupings. In other cases, the commonly used “uniform phase” models might not be appropriate, and ramped, exponential, or normal distributions of events might be more useful. When considering analyses of these kinds, it is useful to be able run simulations on synthetic data. Methods for performing such tests are discussed here along with other methods of diagnosing possible problems with statistical models of this kind.}

I frame data as discursive media that communicate archaeological encounters, which enable archaeologists to form productive collaboration relationships. All archaeological activities involve data work, as archaeologists simultaneously account for the decisions and circumstances that framed the information they rely on to perform their own practices, while anticipating how their information outputs will be used by others in the future. All archaeological activities are therefore loci of practical epistemic convergence, where meanings are negotiated in relation to communally-held objectives. Through observations of and interviews with archaeologists at work, and analysis of the documents they produce, I articulate how data sharing relates distributed work experiences as part of a continuum of practice. I highlight the assumptions and value regimes that underlie the social and technical structures that support productive archaeological work, and draw attention to the inseparable relationship between the management of labour and data. I also relate this discursive view of data sharing to the open data movement, and suggest that it is necessary to develop new collaborative commitments pertaining to data publication and reuse that are more in line with disciplinary norms, expectations, and value regimes.},

Several global and regional efforts are organizing and providing data for conservation and sustainable development research, including the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the European Biodiversity Information Network, and the Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network. Critical to development of this field is building a biodiversity information infrastructure, making primary biodiversity data freely and openly available over the Internet. In addition to specimen and taxonomic data, access to non-biological environmental data is critical to spatial analysis and modeling of biodiversity. Adoption of standards and protocols and development of tools for collection management, data-cleaning, georeferencing, and modeling tools, are allowing a quantum leap in the area.

  abstract = {Lichenometry—a method developed by geologists for dating Holocene moraines and other landforms—has many potential applications in archaeology. Maximum-diameter lichenometry can suggest ages for features that were initially lichen-free, such as the moai of Easter Island, and rock surfaces exposed by toolstone quarrying. Size-frequency analysis can provide dates for structures built of lichen-covered rocks, such as game-drive walls and blinds, meat caches, and tent rings. Both methods require local calibration curves, best constructed by measuring lichens on substrata of known exposure age. Most lichenometric studies have involved yellow members of the crustose genus Rhizocarpon, which grow slowly and can live for as long as 10,000 years. Lichenometry has been particularly successful on siliceous rock types in arctic, subarctic, and alpine-tundra environments. The effects of wildfire and of competition from foliose lichens make the technique less well suited for forested terrain. Few data are available for tropical or desert environments or for calcareous substrata. The reliability of a lichenometric date will depend on the quality of the calibration curve, the size of the sample, the nature and postoccupational history of the substratum, and the ability of the archaeologist to recognize potential disturbance factors. An ecological perspective is essential. Known archaeological applications and problems are discussed., RésuméLa liquenometría—un método desarrollado por geólogos para estimar las edades de morenas y otros relieves terrestres del Holeoceno-tiene muchos aplicaciónes potenciales en arqueología. Los diámetros máximos de líquenes pueden proveer fechas para objectos que originalmente no los poseían, por ejemplo los moai de la Isla Pascua, y las rocas de las canteras utilizadas para la fabricación de herramientas. Análisis de tamaño-frequencia puede brindar estimaciones de las edades de estructuras construidas de piedras previamente cubiertas de líquenes, tales como los muros y refugios usados para la caza y el acecho, depósitos para la carne, y los cimientos de las tiendas. Ambos métodos requieren curvas de calibración derivados localmente, mejor construidas midiendo líquenes en superficies de edad conocida. La mayoridad de estudios liquenometricos han empleado especies amarillas del género Rhizocarpon, las que crecen lentamente y pueden vivir mientras 10,000 años. La liquenometría ha sido particularmente exitosa sobre piedras siliciosas en la tundra ártica y alpina. Los efectos de fuego, y la competencia de líquenes foliosos, hacen el método menos idóneo para ser utilizado en el terreno forestal. Poca información existe sobre los medios ambientes tropicales o desérticos. La fiabilidad de una fecha liquenométrica dependeré de la calidad de la curva de calibración, la magnitud de la muestra, el carácter y la historia post-ocupacional de la superficie, y la capacidad del arqueólogo para reconocer potenciales factores de alteración. Una perspectiva ecológica es esencial. Aplicaciones y problemas arqueológicos conocidos están discutidos.},

This paper focuses on the second area of interest in weathering phenomena, in providing evidence supporting the efforts of estimating the age of rock art, most especially that of petroglyphs. In this area, weathering is arguably the most promising variable in the 'direct dating' methodology that has been developed in recent decades. The reasons for the failures of alternative dating methods are explored, leading to the proposition that weathering and related features offer the most reliable basis for future work in this field. Some of this new methodology is discussed within the overall context of the considerable difficulties generally experienced in rock art dating. Particular attention is given to the geometry of weathering, which is often most amenable to quantification, including that of the taphonomy of stone tools and rockshelters.}

It is argued that coins, as part of material culture, need to be examined within the theoretical framework of historical archaeology and material-culture studies. Through several case studies we demonstrate how coins, through their integration of text, image and existence as material objects, offer profound insights not only into matters of economy and the ‘big history’ of issuers and state organization but also into ‘small histories’, cultural values and the agency of humans and objects. In the formative period of archaeology in the 19th century the study of coins played an important role in the development of new methods and concepts. Today, numismatics is viewed as a field apart. The mutual benefits of our approach to the fields of archaeology and numismatics highlight the need for a new and constructive dialogue between the disciplines.},

  abstract = {All archaeologists are required to know something about the sequence of artefacts, cultures and sites which are their stock in trade, but most of them, most of the time, take the framework for the chronology of a given period or civilization for granted, on the grounds that it has been carefully built up over many years, and the foundations cannot constantly be questioned. But the ways in which that framework has been constructed may be many and various, not all of equal reliability. In this chapter the main sources for the construction of archaeological chronologies are presented, and some examples of reliable—and unreliable—chronologies discussed. To those brought up in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, the genealogical lists in the early books of the Old Testament serve as a vivid reminder of how time-depth could be expressed in the ancient world. This indeed was the basis for the calculation that has made James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh between 1625 and 1656, famous to generations of archaeologists: that the Creation occurred in the year 4004 BC. The details of his calculation are unimportant, and the result itself merely of historical interest, but the method is significant. By assuming that a generation was of X years, and that there had been Y generations prior to defined historical events as recorded in the Bible, the years elapsed were X times Y, an absolute number of years that can be related to historical and thence to modern times.},

In doing so it looks at some of the problems associated with the subject and at the levels of precision possible. After outlining the techniques associated with the measurement and processing of tree-ring patterns, the author traces an attempt to construct such an independent chronology in a new area. The book breaks naturally into sections conditioned by the availability of timbers and these can be listed as modern, late medieval, medieval, early medieval and prehistoric. As far as possible the results are presented in the order in which things happened, thus preserving the sense of a developing subject.},

Renault-Miskovsky (Institut de Paléontologie humaine, Paris). One of the objectives was building a database of the human occupation of Europe during this period. The database has been enlarged and now includes Lower, Middle and Upper Palaeolithic sites connecting them to their environmental conditions and the available chronometric dating. From version 14 on, only sites with chronometric data were included. In this database we have collected the available radiometric data from literature and from other more restricted databases. We try to incorporate newly published chronometric dates, collected from all kind of available publications. Only dates older than 9500 uncalibrated BP, correlated with a "cultural" level obtained by scientific excavations of European (Asian Russian Federation included) Palaeolithic sites, have been included. The dates are complemented with information related to cultural remains, stratigraphic, sedimentologic and palaeontologic information within a Microsoft Access database. For colleagues mainly interested in a list of all chronometric dates an Microsoft Excel list (with no details) is available (Tab. 1). A file, containing all sites with known coordinates, that can be opened for immediate use in Google Earth is available as a *.kmz file. It will give the possibility to introduce (by file open) in Google Earth the whole site list in "My Places". The database, version 27 (first version was available in 2002), contains now 13,202 site forms, (most of them with their geographical coordinates), comprising 17,022 radiometric data: Conv. 14C and AMS 14C (13,144 items), TL (678 items), OSL (1050 items), ESR, Th/U and AAR (2150 items) from the Lower, Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. All 14C dates are conventional dates BP. This improved version 27 replaces the older version 26.}

Umgekehrt, je präziser ein Fundplatz datiert ist, desto größer die Wahrscheinlichkeit, daß er zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt bestanden hat. Die Verteilung der weniger genau datierten Fundplätze auf eine festgelegte Zeiteinheit, beispielsweise 25, 50 oder 100 Jahre, kann gleichmäßig, also wie in der aoristischen Analyse, oder proportional zu den besser datierten erfolgen oder derart, d a ß bestehende „Lücken" gefüllt werden.},

  abstract = {Aoristic analysis is often used to handle chronological uncertainties of datasets where scientific dates (e.g. 14C, OSL, etc.) are not available, and observations are described by association to archaeological periods or phases. While several advances have been made over the last two decades, the basic principle of this approach remains fundamentally the same.  Temporal windows of analyses are first divided into regularly sized time-blocks and probability weight is assigned to each of these for every observation. Weights are then aggregated by time-block, and the resulting vector of summed probabilities is interpreted as a curve representing changes in the intensity over time of a particular phenomenon. This paper reviews the basic principles and assumptions of aoristic analyses in archaeology, highlighting several issues with its application and interpretation and advocating for a Bayesian alternative implemented via baorista, a new package written in R statistical computing language. The robustness of the proposed solution is evaluated through a series of experiments based on simulated datasets, which showcase key advantages over aoristic analysis. Two specific solutions are considered, a parametric approach where data are fitted to specific growth models and a non-parametric approach that allows a visualisation of the changing frequencies of events that account for sampling error and the peculiarities of archaeological periodisation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first review of biases impacting Pleistocene and Holocene radiocarbon dates from Central Africa. Based on the pooling of the research expertise of the co-authors, twenty-four biases are listed, explained and documented and their impact on any radiocarbon date corpus demonstrated. To achieve this, a new corpus has been created of 1764 radiocarbon and TL assays from 601 archaeological sites published in the literature. Each date has been checked for its context. The irregular dynamics of research in space and time seriously impact the end result of previous analyses aiming to achieve a regional understanding of past demographic fluctuations. While peaks in the number of dates from the late Holocene seem to correspond to a positive demographic trend, it is suggested that the declines identified cannot be of any such use for the time being and that today’s picture does not presently support claims of a population “crash” at a regional or local level for any time period. The numbers are obscured by overall research deficits identifiable throughout the region. The maps of the dated sites presented offer good evidence of this and illustrate the vast expanses where no archaeological research has yet been carried out. The number of radiocarbon dates in Central Africa is more an indicator of the effort archaeologists have put into understanding a settlement than it is of ancient demographics. Successive waves of incoming people since c. 3500–3000 cal. BP, the two most important ones known since the 1990s, have created a cultural mosaic of coexisting technological groups. The last 40 years of research have revealed the inner complexity of these waves, some of which avoided parts of the region for centuries, thereby creating an irregular cultural mosaic of land use that is outlined by patterning in the radiocarbon dates.}
