	abstract = {Current conventions for reporting radiocarbon determinations do not cover the reporting of calibrated dates. This article proposes revised conventions that have been endorsed by many 14C scientists. For every determination included in a scientific paper, the following should apply: (1) the laboratory measurement should be reported as a conventional radiocarbon age in 14C yr {BP} or a fractionation-corrected fraction modern (F14C) value; (2) the laboratory code for the determination should be included; and (3) the sample material dated, the pretreatment method applied, and quality control measurements should be reported. In addition, for every calibrated determination or modeled date, the following should be reported: (4) the calibration curve and any reservoir offset used; (5) the software used for calibration, including version number, the options and/or models used, and wherever possible a citation of a published description of the software; and (6) the calibrated date given as a range (or ranges) with an associated probability on a clearly identifiable calendar timescale.},

	doi = {10.1017/RDC.2019.21},
	abstract = {The development of chronologies relies on integrating information from a
number of different sources. In addition to direct dating evidence, such
as radiocarbon dates, researchers will have contextual information which
might be an environmental sequence or the context in an archaeological
site. This information can be combined through Bayesian or other types of
age-model. Once a chronology has been developed, this information can be
used to estimate, for example, chronological uncertainties, rates of
change, or the age of material which has not been directly dated.Dealing
with the information associated with chronology building is complicated
and re-evaluation of chronologies often requires structured information
which is hard to access. Although there are many databases with primary
dating information, these often do not contain all of the information
needed for a chronology. The Chronological Query Language ({CQL}) developed
for {OxCal} was intended to be a convenient way of pulling such information
together for Bayesian analysis. However, even this does not include much
of the associated information required for reusing data in other
analyses.The {IntChron} initiative builds on the framework set up for the
{INTIMATE} (Integrating Ice core, Marine and Terrestrial Records)
chronological database (Bronk Ramsey et al. 2014) and is primarily an
information exchange format and data visualization tool which enables
users to pull together the types of information needed for chronological
analysis. It is intended for use with multiple dating methodologies and
while it will be integrated with {OxCal}, is intended to be an open format
suitable for use with other software tools. The file format is {JSON} which
is easily readable in software such as R, Python and {MatLab}. {IntChron} is
not primarily intended to be a data depository but rather an index of
sites where information is stored in the relevant format. As an initial
step, databases of radiocarbon dates from the Oxford Radiocarbon
Accelerator Unit (including those for the {NERC} radiocarbon facility), the
{RESET} tephra database, the {INTIMATE} chronological database and regional
radiocarbon databases for Egypt and Southern Africa are all linked. The
intention is that users of {OxCal} will also be able to make published data
accessible to others and to store working data, visible only to the user,
to be used with the associated analysis tools. The {IntChron} site allows
data from third party sources to be accessed through a representational
state transfer ({REST}) application programming interface ({API}) in a number
of different formats ({JSON}, csv, txt, oxcal) and associated bibliographic
information in {BibTeX} format.The aim of the {IntChron} initiative is to make
it easy for users to provide data (in the single {JSON} format with limited
minimum requirements) as well as to access data and tools, while promoting
robust chronologies including realistic estimates of uncertainties. It is
hoped that this will help to bring the chronological research communities
to a point where data access is as easy as it is in some other fields.
This is particularly important for Early Career Researchers and for those
seeking to use large datasets in novel ways.},

	abstract = {Archaeologists increasingly use large radiocarbon databases to model prehistoric human demography (also termed paleo-demography). Numerous independent projects, funded over the past decade, have assembled such databases from multiple regions of the world. These data provide unprecedented potential for comparative research on human population ecology and the evolution of social-ecological systems across the Earth. However, these databases have been developed using different sample selection criteria, which has resulted in interoperability issues for global-scale, comparative paleo-demographic research and integration with paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental data. We present a synthetic, global-scale archaeological radiocarbon database composed of 180,070 radiocarbon dates that have been cleaned according to a standardized sample selection criteria. This database increases the reusability of archaeological radiocarbon data and streamlines quality control assessments for various types of paleo-demographic research. As part of an assessment of data quality, we conduct two analyses of sampling bias in the global database at multiple scales. This database is ideal for paleo-demographic research focused on dates-as-data, bayesian modeling, or summed probability distribution methodologies.},
